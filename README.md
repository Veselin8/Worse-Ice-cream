<ins>Worse Ice-Cream</ins>

We decided to replicate a beloved video game _Bad Ice-Cream_ in our own style. We have the player, our ice cream who can move left, right, up and down on the board. His goal is to collect all the coins (fruit) on the board in the given time limit without getting caught bz a monster. To help him reach his goal, the ice cream can create and destroy ice blocks which can help him block the monster from reaching him.
